**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter is the inner workings of a neural network in a diffusion model. The students worked with a 2D Swiss roll dataset.

These are some questions I investigated to better understand diffusion models:
- If you diffuse an oval-shaped cluster so it becomes a circular cluster, what path does each data point take? Do the points move at different speeds or the same speed? 
- If the dataset has two clusters, will each data point return to its original cluster or the nearest one?
- If you fix a point in the noise, will that point end up at different final locations every time you run? What will the distribution of final results look like?
- If we set time_steps = HUGE number, would it make the reverse process a lot harder?

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

I will continue investigating points in the 2D space or move on to images. I can possibly contribute something to the open-source platform of Stable Diffusion. I want to try fine-tuning a Stable Diffusion model to perform tasks such as generating more images of myself. 

**What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

For my quarter 1 Project, I am replicating the forward and reverse diffusion process performed on a spiral dataset. For my quarter 2 project, I want to work with existing open-source code to push the limits of what I can create.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I'm interested in using Stable Diffusion.
