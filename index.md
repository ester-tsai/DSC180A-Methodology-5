**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter is the inner workings of a neural network in a diffusion model. I traced the movement of a point in the reverse diffusion process in a 2D example.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
I will continue investigating points in the 2D space or move on to images. I can possibly contribute something to the open-source platform of Stable Diffusion. I want to try fine-tuning a Stable Diffusion model to perform tasks such as generating more images of myself. 

**What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
For my quarter 1 Project, I am replicating the forward and reverse diffusion process performed on a spiral dataset. For my quarter 2 project, I want to work with existing open-source code to push the limits of what I can create.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I'm interested in using Stable Diffusion.
